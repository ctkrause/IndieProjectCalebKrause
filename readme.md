Caleb Krause Individual Project

Problem Statement

As students, we are all working towards common goals. We are here to improve our technical skills and 
increase our marketability to potential employers. For anyone involved in a two year I.T. program at MATC
that includes obtaining a position for an internship. Personally, I have spent many hours perusing innumerable 
job boards that seemingly all contain the same jobs from recruiters and few, if any actual leads. 
The idea for my individual project is to hone in on sites that could actually be useful and present those job
leads in a pleasing manner that is helpful to the average student that may be in the hunt for a job or internship.
