### Week 2 
- Chose a project goal based on my disdain for existing job searches
- Created my individual project repository for all project version control
- Wrote my problem statement
- Began listing some technologies that I know and I'm sure more will be added later

I know that I want to accomplish with this project, but I'm not 100% sure yet how I'm going to do so. There has been talks
of screen scraping web services that could help me grab job data from existing job boards. The key for me is organing those 
jobs in a manner which meets or exceeds my own expectations.

### Week 3 
The exercise for week 3 left me feeling frustrated and a bit peeved. I fought with it for around 11 hours, which didn't
leave me time to do the legwork I wanted on my project. The only thing that I did do was I added the hibernate and log4j
config files as I was impelementing them in the weekly work. Hopefully that saves me some time down the road.

### Week 4 -
- Double checked all checkpoint one deliverables

More to come here, hopefully. This week I'll be implementing a DAO and creating a javabean which will be annotated for
Hibernate. Going to be adding unit testing for said DAO and making sure all Hibernate techniques I've learned to this point
are successfully implemented.
